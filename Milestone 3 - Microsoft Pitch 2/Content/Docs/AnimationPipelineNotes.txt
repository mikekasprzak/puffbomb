
Sketch frame roughs on a layer in the center. (thin pen?)

If you need to find the right pose arangement, do pose roughs off to the left or right.

If relative to the first frame, make the first frame a static whiteboard.

Make a floor static whiteboard guide as well.

- Verify that the flash exporter of ToonBoom omits unused drawings.  Else, we're going to have to
do more research.
** Yes.

- Find more information about the SWF file format.  Cleary it is a simple binary format, but a spec
would be nice.
** Okay, it's complex, but there are libraries out there.  Moho uses them... I think.

- Find a library for loading/importing SWF files
** Haven't found one yet.  Ming used by moho is an exporter..

- Find a Vector Rendering Library that can antialias vectors
** Antigrain - http://www.antigrain.com/

- Or find an app that can read and render SWF
** Flirt (http://flirt.sf.net/) is an SWF rendering library.  It's a buggy renderer, but could be a
foundation for a reader.
