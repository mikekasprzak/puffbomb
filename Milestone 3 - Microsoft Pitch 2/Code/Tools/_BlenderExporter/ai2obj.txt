This is a modified version of the ai2obj.py script.

origonally this importer converted all the pieces of a .ai file into a single object

now it seperates everything into its own object. and attempts to open all the objects when its done.

what you need to do because of a bug with blender is once you have converted the .ai file into tons of little .obj files is to
close blender and open the first .0.OOO.obj file and it should open them all correctly
