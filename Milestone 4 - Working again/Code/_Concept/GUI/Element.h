	class cElement {
	public:
		// Pos -- The "notable" home point of an element //
		// If physics or 3D are introduced in to the GUI system, this simply becomes a home //
		// Reference point for new instances. Smart code behind the system can use this point for //
		// knowing where to center or to rest, or similar such uses. //
		Vector2D Pos;
		
		// GroupId -- Basic hierarchical grouping implementation //
		// Through accessor functions, like in current system, perform group actions on all //
		// members of the group, such as setting visibility //
		int GroupId;
		
		// Value -- Basic incremental numerical contents //
		// Checkboxes or toggle menu items have values of 0 or 1.  Multi select would have 0 or //
		// more to choose from.  Value should be controlled via accessor functions that through //
		// virtual function correctly clip it to it's range.  If unused, then it's not important. //
		int Value;
		
		// IsVisible -- Flag for noting individual element visibilty //
		// Parent objects will determine visibilty for all it's children, but this is control on //
		// an individual object level.  Usually combined with the GroupId concept. //
		bool IsVisible;
		
		
		// Other (Not sure if these are appropriate) -------------------------------------------- //
		
		// Selection Orderings.  Important, but there are 2 distinct ways it can be approached //
		
		// TabStop -- While not technically "tab", it's the order to "Tab" to //
		// The positive numeric ordering to follow when going forward/back.  If negative (-1) //
		// then ignore this object in flow orderings. //
		int TabStop;
		
		// Tab stop might be too archaic of a concept, so the alternative is to use positional //
		// information, and simply note if it's on the list of things or not, given the desired //
		// selection direction. //
		
		// IsSelectable -- Is it selectable, hence, if its the nearest element below me, pushing //
		// down goes to it. It's either this, or TabStop.  //
		bool IsSelectable;
		
		// Technically, both implementations are fine.  Generally speaking, a cohesive menu that //
		// flows top to bottom is more natural, and only to the left/right on accept/cancel //
		// actions. //
		
		// The third option is linear order.  Essentially, selecting objects by the order in the //
		// Gui info file.  There's honestly no real advantage to this, short of 2-3 lines easier //
		// of an implementation.  Selectable + Position disregards and can order nicely.  TabStop //
		// alone can do the order just fine, but tabstopping is more effort than Selectable + //
		// Position because the tabstop needs to be set/identified.  It's very uncommon to want //
		// to select things out of a cohesive top to bottom order (1, 3, 2).  A reasonable //
		// restriction. //
		
		// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
		
		// Parental relationship. //
		// There are many advantages to knowing who your parent is, specifically, the ability to //
		// step backwards in a heiarchy to learn about your neighbours/parents parent/etc. //
		
		// This is essential to a game engine, but optional for a Gui system.  However, for the //
		// added flexibility for custom code, it's probably worth doing. //
		
		// This leads to functions such as "ScreenPos" for an objects real screen position.  It's //
		// implemented by stepping up the tree to the root (no parent) and suming the positions //
		// found in every element.  Not a bad function to have, though drawing can work without //
		// it since it's the root that will request the draw operation, and traveling down the //
		// tree is a natual feature of a heiarchy. //
		
		// The "root" should be a member of the manager class.  There's no reason for it to be a //
		// dynamic member like every element.  It can be the base type as well. //
		
		// Parent -- Whom lives/goes before me in the heiarchy //
		cElement* Parent;

		// General implementation of a work function.  Follows internal game framerate. //
