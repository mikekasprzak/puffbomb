
Install MinGW in C:\MinGW\ from "www.mingw.org"
Install Msys in C:\MSYS\ from "www.mingw.org"

Create a batch file under C:\MinGW that contains the following (shell.bat).

@echo off
title MinGW Shell
set path=C:\MinGW\bin;%path%
set MINGDIR=C:\MinGW
cmd

Download and install boost in either your mingw or msys installation.  Sorry, I don't actually
know how to do that.  I cheated and put it in a folder, and added a cheating searching link to find
it in the makefile.

Download the latest unstable Allegro from "alleg.sf.net".
Uncompress this somewhere where you can build other tools.  C:\root\allegro for example.
The logic behind root is a folder for a CVS root.  Since I also use SVN, the thought is to merge
the ideas of a repository root into one.  ReposRoot might be a better name.

Download and install the dx7 and optionally the dx8 files from the allegro page.  These archives
contain lib and include folders.  Simply uncompress them into your mingw folder, over the originals
and they'll go in the right place.

From "shell.bat", build it like so:
fix mingw32
mingw32-make STATICLINK=1
mingw32-make STATICLINK=1 install

Download the latest CVS version of AllegroGL from "allegrogl.sf.net".
To grab CVS, you might want Cygwin Installed, with such tools as commandline CVS and SVN.  Cygwin is
available from "www.cygwin.com".  Or, TortoiseCVS

The repository name is "alleggl".
You need to, under cygwin or mingw, run a shell script under misc called "mkalias.sh".  It creates
some missing files for you.

Then it will compile.

From "shell.bat", build it like so:
fix mingw32
mingw32-make STATICLINK=1
mingw32-make STATICLINK=1 install

Done.

Go to the PuffBOMB folder under msys and run "make" or "make run" to do stuff.
