2 friends (girl and other kid)

- Parents always go in to isolation, until their children reach a certain age
- In this isolation, they don't use their powers, so the children don't realize they have them
- the reason they do this, is because of ... problems
- if a member of their race develops powers at too young of an age, they become too powerful too fast
- it's sort of like a puberty thing... at least that sounds like a good grounds for developing the humor
- humor should also start in a sense, :
  - 1 "oh... right... and I have super powers... I can 'manifest' (spooky sounding)... oh I donno... explosives?  Yeah right."
  - silence
  - 1 "What?  What does that look mean?"
  - 2 "Well, actually..."
  - 1 "What!?!"
  - 2 "You see..."
  - 1 "Guah... Nooooo!  No way!"
  - 2 "I mean it's..."
  - 1 "ok, funny... haw haw... I'm not falling for this."
  - something happens
  - hisssss
  - 1 "very funny, you... uhh...  what's that noise?"
  - jaboom!
- ok that sucks, but it's a start

Arc Possibility

- the friends discover their powers early, somehow
- the 3 secretly try to learn them
- so you're almost evil yourself
- chicky, however, goes too far, and somethnig goes wrong. (dark side)
- somehow, you and dude manage to clue in before it's too late (light side)
- then for fun, the learn the truth as mentioned above from parents.
