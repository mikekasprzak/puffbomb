Add these environment variables:

DISTC_HOSTS=localhost ComputerA ComputerB

Where ComputerA and B are additional computers.  Also put them in the order of priority.

Next:

TMPDIR=/c/msys/junk

Or another folder to hold junk or temp files.  Use the full valid path.  /tmp may work, but caused
us problems in the past.

Then go in to your registry and change the "/cygdrive" to "/", thus making all paths relative to /.
Or the other option is to just install the "CygwinMounts.reg" registry file.

A standard daemon execution:

distccd --daemon --allow 192.168.0.0/24

Put the "run" shell script in "C:\mingw\bin", and verify that Mike fixed the execution line
appropriately.
