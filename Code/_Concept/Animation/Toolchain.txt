
File named generation, and other content notes
--------------------

Currently, frameholds for animation are generated from a generic hold applied to the entire animation.
What's needed is more detail in the ability to define it.

My solution, two solutions.

Expand on the functionality used to get information on the command line.  Follow the entire listing
of all arguments, and accumulate actions found.  Currently, when we say "half", no matter how
many times we say it, it's only done once.  These should now be compounded.  This should be combined
with the next solution as well.

Solution 2, is a general solution that should be applied moreover in the engine design.  A text
information file where you can type important things in to it.  Transformations to apply to all or
specific images, processes to run, target outputs, etc.

This should be implemented in such a way that we can create mulitple platform profiles.

Assets.Wii.pro perhaps?
Assets.GL.pro
