
FileIO
------

This needs to be standardized soon.  Right now there are multiple systems used for collecting data,
and multiple methods of handling it.  Yet, many of them are very similar.

At the core, there needs to be a standard FileIO library, a means to read and write text and binary
data.  It can rely on existing systems, and should, for ease of implementation.

On the PC's, the stream library is adequate, yet we have access to the C style file IO as well.
It's of interest to perhaps to a C style File IO implementation, to easily port, as you're not 100%
sure you'll have such an implementation available.  Some fancy subsystems, such as acquiring data
from over the internet can most certainly benefit from a common interface.

Also, for some reason, C file io has a lower code size bottleneck.  Not a significant issue, but 
one to take note of none the less, given the ease of implementation (reading, writing, done).

Directories also need to be considered in the heiarchy of things.  There are existing systems
implemented in the pools, that could probably be standardized and streamlined.
