Hey Me!

When building Lua via make, there's a setting called "generic".  This builds the library without
the crazy ass MinGW DLL stupidity.  The file "INSTALL" then tells you what files you actually need.

If you want configure the library, start in "luaconf.h".  Unfortunately, LUA is not designed to 
easily convert the default type from double to float/int.  It should in theory work, but internally
the math library will be calling double versions of math functions (sin(), cos(), instead of fsin()
and fcos()).

In a game situation, you will likely want a personal copy of Lua that you can modify in the engine.
This way, you can make the above changes to an int or float, and other respected fixes as needed,
and not have to deal with silly external dependacies.

An option as well is to have a local separate Lua repository, and use an external reference.  This
could be the case for all external libraries, have local repositories for them, and update them as
needed.  In most situations, that'll be when new notable versions come out.  For some, Lua mainly,
it'll be to make notable changes to suit integration in a codebase.
